Proof supports the typesetting mathematics using [$\KaTeX$](https://katex.org).
You can use `$ .. $` to write formulas following the $\LaTeX$ math syntax:

~~~ markdown
The function $\nu$ is written inline, but can also be in a block:
\\[ \nu: \mathbb{P}^{1} \to \mathbb{P}^{3} \\]
~~~

The function $\nu$ is written inline, but can also be in a block:
\\[ \nu: \R\P^{1} \to \P^{3}. \\]

Multiple math formats work:
- `$5\times 5$` gives $5\times 5.$
- `\\(5\times 5\\)` gives \\(5\times 5.\\)
- `\\[5\times 5.\\]` gives: \\[5\times 5.\\]

**Note:** while `$$ 5\times 5 $$` also works, it will enclose the math in a
script tag, which is undesirable[^katex].

$\KaTeX$ supports a [long list] of fonts and functions, but you can also add
$\LaTeX$ macros in `<script>` tags. For instance:

~~~ html
<script>
macros["\\f"] = "\\mathscr{F}"
</script>
~~~

<script>
macros["\\f"] = "\\mathscr{F}"
</script>

\\[ 0\to\Gamma_Y(X,\f')\to\Gamma_Y(X,\f)\to\Gamma_Y(X,\f'')\to 0. \\]

If you are not familiar with writing mathematics in $\LaTeX$, I highly
recommend reading and bookmarking this [Wikibooks reference] and using
it to typeset problem sets or exercises to practice. Another great reference
is [this "short" guide] by the AMS. To learn more about $\LaTeX$ itself,
[D.R.Wilkins' Primer] is a decent place to start.

    This will change once this [issue](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/pull/545) is fixed.
